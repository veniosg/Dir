A modern Android file manager. 

Forked from http://veniosg.github.io/Dir/

Development Setup
--------
Option 1: Android Development Studio

Prerequisites
- Download and install [Android Development Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- It is helpful to install the Android Emulator with it (use custom install)

Setup
- Rename keystore.properties.example to keystore.properties (No instructions yet for values)
- Build -> Make Project. In the first attempt, the build will fail and show an error with a link to download Android Platform and Android Build Tools. Follow these links which will open the Component Installer to download and install these
- Sync Gradle
- Build -> Make Project should then succeed
